        <p class="text-xl mb-6">
          Themba's journey began in the heart of Africa, where she was born into a lineage of exceptional Rhodesian Ridgebacks. Her name, "Themba," means "hope" in Zulu, and she lives up to this name in every way.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl mb-6">
          From her early days, Themba showed remarkable intelligence, strength, and a gentle spirit that captured the hearts of everyone she met. Her distinctive ridge, a hallmark of her breed, runs proudly along her back, telling the story of her heritage.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl mb-6">
          Now, Themba is preparing to welcome her first litter of puppies, continuing the legacy of excellence in her bloodline. Each puppy will inherit not just her physical traits, but also her remarkable temperament and loving nature.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl">
          We are excited to share this special journey with you and look forward to finding loving homes for each of her puppies. Stay tuned for updates on the pregnancy and the arrival of the new generation of exceptional Rhodesian Ridgebacks.
